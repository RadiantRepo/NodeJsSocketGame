# NodeJsSocketGame

This project implements a multiplayer socket colouring cell game. Multiple clients can connect to the server and click cell's displayed on their browser.
When a cell is clicked, the colour of the cell changes to the colour assigned by the server to the player. THe colour is also distributed to every client in order
to reflect the most recent cell colouring action from a given player.
The project can serve as a brilliant learning resource for developers interested in seeing the application of web sockets and develop their web socket design skills
further. The source code intends to reduce the saturation of comments and therefore the naming length of variables and functions is slightly longer but more 
descriptive.
